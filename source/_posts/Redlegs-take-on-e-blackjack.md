#  Redlegs take on e-blackjack

The redlegs are a type of blackjack that is played with an extra card. This makes the game more difficult, but it also offers players a better chance of winning. The redlegs are also known as "two-card blackjack", and they offer players the opportunity to make some pretty big wins.

To play the redlegs, you will need to have at least two people playing. You can also play this game with more people, but it will be more difficult. The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player who gets closest to 21 without going over wins the hand.

If you are playing with two people, each player gets two cards. If you are playing with more than two people, each player gets three cards. The extra card in the redlegs is called the "redleg". The redleg is placed in the middle of the table, and all of the players can see it.

The player who goes first in a hand is decided randomly. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table. On a player's turn, they must do one of three things:

1) Take another card - If the player thinks that they can improve their hand by taking another card, they can do so by hitting. When they hit, they take another card from the deck and add it to their hand.
2) Stand - If the player thinks that they have a good enough hand, they can stand and end their turn.
3) Double down - If the player thinks that their hand is strong enough, they can double down by doubling their original bet and taking only one more card.

After all of the players have had a chance to act, the dealer will draw cards until they have 16 or higher. At this point, they must stand no matter what their hand contains. The dealer will always hit untilthey reach 17 or higher.

If both players have 21 or less (or if one has blackjack and one doesn't), then the player with 21 or less (or blackjack) automatically wins unless the dealer has blackjack too; in which case it's a push). If both players go over 21, then the player with the highest total wins (except for blackjack; see above). In case of a tie other than blackjack*,the pot is split equally between both players
