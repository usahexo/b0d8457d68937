#  Third Time's the Charm: Poker Pro Clinches Victory at Cuoc8899

The last time poker pro Fan Xiao triumphed at an online tournament was over two years ago. However, that all changed on November 12th when he won the Cuoc8899 tournament, taking home the top prize of $101,752.

The final table was a competitive one, with some of the world's top players vying for the title. Xiao narrowly edged out his opponents, ultimately defeating Russian player "hellokitty" in heads-up play to take first place.

For Xiao, this victory is particularly sweet given that it comes just a few weeks after he narrowly missed out on a bracelet at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Europe. In addition to the money and prestige that comes with winning a major poker tournament, Xiao also qualifies for next year's WSOP main event.

For players looking to follow in Xiao's footsteps and win big online, Cuoc8899 is definitely worth checking out. The tournament features a range of buy-in levels and offers some of the best prizes in Asian poker.

#  Another Early Exit for Pro at Cuoc8899

This morning, Vietnamese pro Nguyen Van Truong (known as Pro) became the latest high-profile casualty of the $88,999 USD Cuoc8899 online poker tournament.

Truong's departure follows on from similar exits by Indonesia's Ivan Sucktion (second in last month's 82nd edition of the WSOP) and Chinese superstar Dong Kim.

The three-day event, which began on Saturday evening, has now whittled down its remaining contestants to just 15 players. These include Denmark's Allan Glueckert (who currently leads the pack with 2.6 million in chips), Canadian Ami Barer and American prodigy Chris Moorman.

As for Truong, his elimination came at the hands of Russian player Andrey Churakov who busted him out in 26th place with a pair of aces against Truong's two kings. This took Churakov's chipstack up to 2 million – good enough for fourth place overall.

A veteran of the Asian live tournament scene, Truong has racked up some impressive results in his career including a win at the 2017 APT Macau Main Event worth over US$174,000. His exit from the Cuoc8899 will no doubt be a disappointment, but he can take comfort in the knowledge that he still has plenty of opportunities to make big money online.
