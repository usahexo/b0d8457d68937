#  Maryland Hollywood Casino Reveals How Gaming Duty Revenue Is Divvied Up

The Maryland Live! Casino, just outside of Baltimore, has revealed how it distributes gaming duties to the state and local governments. The casino said that it paid $107.9 million in gaming taxes and other fees to state and local governments in 2017.

The revelation is interesting as it provides a glimpse into how much money casinos pay in taxes and how the money is divided up. For example, the casino said that it paid Baltimore City $16.5 million in gaming duty revenue last year. This accounted for 15% of the city's total budget for 2017.

Casinos in Maryland are required to pay a 55% tax on gaming revenue. This money goes to the state with local governments receiving a share depending on where the casino is located. For example, Anne Arundel County, which is home to Maryland Live!, receives 5% of the state's gaming revenue while Baltimore City receives 8%.

The distribution of gaming duty revenue has been a topic of debate in recent years. Some lawmakers have argued that more money should be given to local governments, especially those that are home to casinos. Others have argued that the money should go directly to the state in order to help fund education and other important programs.

This debate is likely to continue in 2019 as lawmakers begin to discuss ways to address a budget shortfall estimated at $1.2 billion. One proposal being discussed would use revenue from video slot machines at racetracks to help close the budget gap. This proposal would redirect part of the money currently going to local governments and send it directly to the state.

It will be interesting to see how this debate develops over the next few months and what impact it may have on casino tax rates.

The Hollywood Casino in Maryland will get an extra $30 million from the state, which was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday. This money is in addition to the $46.5 million that the casino has already paid in taxes.

The new money is coming from a $2 increase in the admissions and table game tax rates. This increase is expected to generate an additional $13.5 million per year for the next three years.

"This legislation is good news for both Hollywood Casino Perryville and Maryland's economy," said House Speaker Michael Busch (D-Anne Arundel County). "The additional revenue generated by these modest rate increases will help support jobs and economic development throughout the state."

#  Maryland Hollywood Casino Amongst Highest Grossing Casinos in the US

Maryland Hollywood Casino is amongst the top casinos in the US as far as grossing is concerned. The casino, which is operated by Penn National Gaming has managed to rake in over $1 billion since it began operations in 2006. This feat ranks it among the 10 highest grossing casinos in the United States.

The casino’s success can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, Maryland Hollywood Casino is strategically located on the outskirts of Baltimore and Washington DC. This makes it easily accessible to a large population base. Secondly, the casino offers a wide variety of gambling options, including slots, table games and poker. Finally, the casino has been able to successfully market itself, thereby building a strong customer base.

While Maryland Hollywood Casino is doing well, it faces some competition from other casinos in the area such as MGM National Harbor and Live! Casino & Hotel. These casinos are also amongst the top 10 grossing casinos in the US and offer similar gaming options.
