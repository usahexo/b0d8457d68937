# How to play blackjack oak in GGBet casino?

Blackjack oak is one of the most popular casino games. It can be played in many online casinos, including GGBet. The following is a guide on how to play blackjack oak in GGBet casino.

First, you need to register for an account with GGBet casino. Then, login and click on the “Casino” tab. Next, find the blackjack oak game and click on it to start playing. The game screen will look like this:

The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting a higher score than him, or by getting 21 points without going over. You can also win by having a blackjack, which is made up of an ace and a ten-point card.

To start playing, you first need to place your bet. The amount you can bet depends on the table limit, but ranges from 0.10 to 100 credits. Once you’ve placed your bet, you can choose how many cards you want to draw from the deck. You can either take all five cards, or just two cards. If you take all five cards, this is called a “hit” and if you take two cards it’s called a “stand”.

Once you’ve drawn your cards, the dealer will also draw his cards. He will then reveal his cards and determine his score. If your score is higher than the dealer’s score, you win! If your score is lower than the dealer’s score, you lose your bet amount.

Here are some other things to keep in mind:
-You can double your bet by hitting “double down” after you’ve drawn your first two cards.-If you think the dealer has a low score (below 17), you can hit another card even if it means going over 21 (this is called “Insurance”).-If the dealer shows an ace as his first card, players have the option of taking insurance (if they haven’t already taken any other action). Insurance pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack (a ten-point card plus an ace).
