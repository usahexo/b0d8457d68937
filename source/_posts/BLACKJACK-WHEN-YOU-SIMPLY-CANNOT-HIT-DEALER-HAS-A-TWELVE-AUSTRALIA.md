#  BLACKJACK: WHEN YOU SIMPLY CANNOT HIT DEALER HAS A TWELVE AUSTRALIA

What plays out in a land-based casino is an awesome experience. But, when it comes to playing blackjack online in Australia, you'll find that there are different rules which are followed.

For a start, the dealer has to stand on any total of seventeen or more and will hit on any total of sixteen or less. Second, splitting aces only results in one extra card being given to each ace. Doubling down can be done after splitting also.

In most cases, online casinos also offer surrender as an option – but only if the Dealer has a natural blackjack (an ace and ten). If you choose to surrender, you'll lose half your bet amount.

It's important to remember that some casinos may have different rules, so it's always best to check these before playing.

#  BLACKJACK STRATEGY: HOW TO WIN WHEN DEALER HITS ON A TWELVE

There is a blackjack strategy that can be used in order to win when the dealer hits on a twelve. This is a move that not many players are aware of, but it can be very effective if used correctly.

The first step is to understand the basic principles of blackjack. In blackjack, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand without going bust. The player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down. The player can then choose to either hit or stand depending on their hand total. If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the game.

When the dealer has a two through six as their face-up card, they will usually hit when they have a twelve as their down-card. So, in order to take advantage of this, the player should stand with a total of twelve as well. This way, if the dealer does hit on a twelve, the player has still got a good chance of winning the hand.

It is important to note that this only applies to certain situations. If the player has an Ace as their first card, for example, they should always hit on a twelve as opposed to standing because their hand total would be seventeen (Ace + six). So, it is crucial to keep track of all of the different possible hands that could be formed in order to make the best decision possible.

Overall, using this blackjack strategy can be a great way to win more hands when playing against the dealer. It may take some practice in order to master it fully, but it is definitely worth trying out!

#  AUSTRALIAN BLACKJACK STRATEGY: HOW TO DEAL WITH WHEN DEALER HAS A TWELVE

roulette is a game of pure chance. There’s no skill involved in playing the game – it’s all down to luck. Right?

Actually, not quite. While there’s no guaranteeing you’ll win when you play roulette, there are definitely ways you can stack the odds in your favour. One such way is to employ a roulette strategy.

There are many different roulette strategies out there, but one of the most popular is the Australian blackjack strategy. This strategy is designed to help you when the dealer has a twelve. Here’s how it works:

1) Firstly, you need to decide whether to bet on red or black. If you choose black, then place your bet on the second column from the left (ie twelve through to twenty-four). If you choose red, then place your bet on the first column (ie one through to six).

2) Once you’ve made your bet, wait for the dealer to turn over their card. If they have a two or three, then double your bet and place it on the corresponding number on the betting grid (eg if the dealer has a two, then double your bet and place it on fourteen). If the dealer has a four or five, then split your bet in two and place it on two adjacent numbers (eg if the dealer has a five, then split your bet and place it on fifteen and sixteen). If the dealer has a six or seven, then stand pat (ie don’t change your bet). If the dealer has an eight or nine, then hit (ie increase your bet by one unit). And if the dealer has a ten or eleven, then decrease your bet by one unit.

3) When it comes time to reveal who has won, look at where your chip(s) are situated on the betting grid. Whatever number this is equal to is your winning number. So for example, if you had placed a £5 chip on black and it was situated over number eighteen on the betting grid at final reveal, then eighteen would be deemed your winning number and you would win 3x (£5) = £15 in total profits from that spin. Similarly, if you had doubled down on fourteen at final reveal and that number turned out to be your winning number instead of say three as initially predicted by this strategy guide; then14 would be deemed as winning number and £10 would be paid out as profit (£20 total stake minus £10 original stake = £10 profit).

It goes without saying that while following this strategy can definitely help increase your chances of coming out ahead when playing roulette; ultimately Lady Luck will always have last say!

#  BLACKJACK TIPS FOR PLAYING WHEN DEALER HAS A TWELVE IN AUSTRALIA



 blackjack is a very popular casino game and when playing at an online casino, australian players will often find the dealer has a twelve up. So, how do you play blackjack when the dealer has a twelve in australia? 

There are a few things to take into account when playing blackjack with a twelve up:

 
- The aim of the game is still to get as close to 21 as possible without going bust, while also beating the dealer's hand. 
- If you have a total of 12 or under, it's best to stick with that total and not risk busting. 
- If your total is over 12, you may want to consider splitting your cards if there are two of the same value (e.g. two sixes). This gives you two separate hands that you can then play independently. 
- If the dealer has a ten or an ace showing, be careful about hitting on totals of 11 or below as they are more likely to bust.

#  CAN Australian BLACKJACK BE BEATEN IF DEALER HAS A TWELVE?

If you're playing blackjack at an online casino in Australia and the dealer has a twelve, can you still beat the house? The answer to that question is somewhat complicated, but in general, the answer is yes.

The first thing that you need to understand about blackjack is that the cards are dealt out in sets of two. So, if the dealer has a twelve as their upcard, that means they have one other card hidden and it's likely to be a six or below. This gives the dealer a total of eighteen, which is still beatable by most players.

In blackjack, your objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. So, even if the dealer has a twelve, you can still win by getting a lucky 21 with your first two cards. If you don't have 21, you can try to beat the dealer's total of 18 by taking more cards until you either hit 21 or go bust.

Just because the dealer has a twelve doesn't mean that you automatically lose though. In fact, there are plenty of times when players can win against dealers with high upcards. It just depends on what cards you're dealt and how risky you want to be.

So, if you're feeling lucky and want to take on the house, then go ahead and play blackjack online in Australia even when the dealer has a twelve. Who knows – maybe you'll be the one who beats them!
