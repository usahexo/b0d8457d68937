#  How to Turn Professional Poker Player in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania is a state in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered by New Jersey and Delaware to the south, Maryland to the east, West Virginia to the north, and Ohio to the west.

The Appalachian Mountains run through the middle of the state. The Susquehanna River and its tributaries form the northwestern border with Maryland and serve as a popular trout stream.

The region was inhabited by historic Native American tribes, including the Algonquian-speaking Lenape Nation and Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. After contact with European colonists, the Lenape became known as the Delaware Indians. The Susquehannock were exterminated by 1675 because they had allied with the Dutch against the English colonists.

In 1681, William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a refuge for Quakers. Philadelphia, founded by Penn in 1682, became an important center of trade and commerce between North America and Europe. Pennsylvania was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in 1776 and became the United States of America.

The state played a pivotal role in establishing independence and democracy in America by signing both the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, ratifying the Bill of Rights, and leading abolitionist movements prior to Civil War. Pennsylvania is home to five original signers of the Declaration of Independence: Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, George Clymer, James Smith, and John Morton.

Franklin—one of history’s most renowned Americans—made his home in Philadelphia where he founded dozens of civic organizations including hospitals, universities, fire companies, lending libraries and insurance companies.Philadelphia served as capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800 while Washington D.C was under construction.
