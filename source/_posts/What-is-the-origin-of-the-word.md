#  What is the origin of the word?

The word "epic" was derived from the Latin word "epicus," which referred to someone who was skilled in poetry or storytelling. The English usage of the word came about in the late 1300s and originally meant "grand, heroic, or significant."

#  What does it mean?

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography to secure their transactions and to control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they are not subject to government or financial institution control. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009.

Cryptocurrencies are often traded on decentralized exchanges and can also be used to purchase goods and services. Their popularity has surged in recent years, with the total value of all cryptocurrencies reaching over $800 billion in January 2018.

# What are the benefits?

Cryptocurrencies offer a number of benefits over traditional currencies. They are:

- Decentralized: Cryptocurrencies are not subject to government or financial institution control, providing greater independence and security.
- Global: Cryptocurrencies can be used anywhere in the world where there is internet access.
- Secure: Cryptocurrencies are secured by cryptography, making them difficult to counterfeit.
- Anonymous: Cryptocurrencies can be used anonymously, providing privacy for users.

Bitcoin also has low transaction fees, making it a more cost-effective option than traditional payment methods.
