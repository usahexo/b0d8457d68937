#  'Wonka' Slots Coming to a Casino Near You

In what may be the biggest development in casino gaming since the advent of electronic slots, the popular Wonka brand of slots is coming to a casino near you.

The Wonka brand, which is owned by the candy maker Mars Inc., has been a massive hit in Europe and other parts of the world, but this will be its first foray into the North American market.

The games will be available at casinos operated by Caesars Entertainment Corp. and slot parlors across the country.

The launch marks a big bet by Mars on the $240 billion global casino gaming industry, which is growing rapidly as more people gamble on their smartphones and tablets.

"Casinos are looking for new ways to bring in guests, and we think our games will do that," said Richard Harris, president of gaming at Mars. "They are colorful and fun, and they offer a different experience than traditional slot machines."

The Wonka games will use licensed characters from the "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" book and movie, including Willy Wonka himself, as well as Oompa Loompas and other favorites.

There will be five different games, each with its own unique bonus features. In one game, for example, players can collect golden tickets that unlock bonuses such as free spins or extra credits.

Wonka is not the only brand targeting casinos lately. Earlier this year, International Game Technology Plc launched "Sesame Street" slots aimed at family audiences.


  So far in 2018, there have been two significant announcements within the casino gaming world. The first being Caesars Entertainment partnering up with candy powerhouse Mars Incorporated to bring over Wonka-themed slot machines to Las Vegas resorts and beyond secondly (and less surprisingly) IGT launching Sesame Street themed slot machines designed explicitly for children's amusement. With brands like these now occupying casino floors across America both adult gamers and parents with young children now have another reason to visit a gambling establishment – pure entertainment value rather than monetary gain (though there's certainly nothing wrong with that too).   If you're unfamiliar with IGT then it might be worth noting that they're one of largest makers of land-based casino games in the entire world. Unlike your usual developer/publisher tandem however IGT produces both software AND hardware; making them one of very few companies capable of supplying complete gaming solutions for operators all over planet Earth (something they've been doing since 1975 when they manufactured their first ever video slot machine). So what does this mean for you as an avid gambler?  Well quite simply put – better games! Keeping up with technological advancements isn't exactly easy for an industry built primarily upon nostalgia but thankfully somebody out there is managing it just fine (*cough* IGT *cough*), especially when it comes to younger demographics who often serve as gatekeepers towards future generations of casino goers…which happens to also include their parents!

#  Another Fun Slot Game: Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory
