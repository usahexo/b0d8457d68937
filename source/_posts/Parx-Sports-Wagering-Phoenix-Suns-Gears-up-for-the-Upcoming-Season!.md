#  Phoenix Suns Betting Action Heats Up at Parx Sports Wagering!

The Phoenix Suns have been a surprise team in the NBA this season and that has led to increased betting action on the Suns at Parx Sports Wagering.

Phoenix comes into Wednesday night’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers with a record of 14-10. That is good for fifth place in the Western Conference and just a half game behind the fourth place Oklahoma City Thunder.

Bettors continue to back the Suns and they have now attracted more bets at Parx over the last two weeks than any other team in the NBA. Phoenix has attracted nearly 60 percent of all money wagered on NBA games at Parx Sports Wagering during that time period.

In terms of straight up wins, Phoenix is ranked ninth in the league with their 14 victories. However, they are one of just six teams in the league that has not yet suffered a double-digit loss on the year. That is why they have been able to draw so much betting action at Parx Sports Wagering; bettors believe they are getting good value on a hot (and currently undervalued) team.

The Trail Blazers enter Wednesday night’s game with a record of 13-11, which puts them in eighth place in the Western Conference. They come into this matchup having won three consecutive games, including an impressive 133-120 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Sunday night.

Portland is currently receiving about 42 percent of all bets placed onWednesday’s game at Parx, but they are favored by just four points. This suggests that most bettors believe there is some risk associated with betting on Phoenix, but also that there is value to be had given the Suns current winning streak.

#  Parx Sports Wagering Ready to Offer Phoenix Suns Wagers!

The Phoenix Suns have had their share of ups and downs this season. Currently, they are battling for a postseason berth in the Western Conference. When it comes to sports wagering, there is always money to be made on teams with good odds (even if they are not on your favorite team).

Phoenix has some intriguing matchups down the stretch, which makes them an appealing option for bettors. With that in mind, Parx Sports Wagering is gearing up to offer Suns bets. The sportsbook has released its early odds for the Suns' games between now and the end of the regular season.

Phoenix will take on the Oklahoma City Thunder this Wednesday, March 13th. Parx has set the line at OKC -4.5 points. The Suns are also 2-point underdogs against the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday, March 14th.

Phoenix's biggest test down the stretch likely comes on Tuesday, March 26th when they travel to Golden State to take on the Warriors. Parx has set the line at Golden State -14 points. The Warriors are a huge favorite in that matchup, but there is still money to be made by betting against them.

 Phoenix is currently in 8th place in the Western Conference standings with a record of 36-29. They are just one game behind the 7th place San Antonio Spurs and two games behind the 6th place Oklahoma City Thunder. If they can continue to play well over these last few weeks of the season, they could very well make it into the playoffs.

#  Place Your Bets on the Phoenix Suns at Parx Sports Wagering!

The Phoenix Suns are a professional basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona. They play in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Suns were founded in 1968 and subsequently joined the NBA in 1969.

The Suns have had a checkered past, but things are looking up for the 2018-2019 season! Here are four reasons why you should place your bets on the Phoenix Suns at Parx Sports Wagering:

1. Devin Booker is an All-Star caliber player.

Devin Booker is one of the most exciting young players in the NBA. He averaged 24.9 points per game last season and was selected to his first All-Star game. He is a threat to score from anywhere on the court and will be a matchup nightmare for opposing teams.

2. The Suns added some key players in the offseason.

The Suns made some key additions to their roster in the offseason, including veteran forward Trevor Ariza and point guard Isaiah Canaan. These players will complement Booker and help the Suns compete against the best teams in the NBA.

3. The Western Conference is wide open this season.

The Western Conference is wide open this season with no clear favorite heading into the playoffs. The Phoenix Suns have as good a chance as any team to make a run at the championship title.

4. The Suns are undervalued by Vegas odds makers.

The Suns are currently listed as 18-1 underdogs by Vegas odds makers to win the NBA championship this season. This presents tremendous value for bettors who believe that the Suns can surprise everyone and make a deep playoff run.
