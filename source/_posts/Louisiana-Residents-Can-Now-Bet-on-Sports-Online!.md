#  Louisiana's Sports Betting Scene is Now Live!

The sports betting scene in Louisiana is now live, making it the fifth US state to offer legal sports betting.

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards authorized the opening of sportsbooks on Monday, September 16th. The first sportsbook, L’Auberge Baton Rouge, opened its doors at 9 a.m. and began accepting bets on college and professional games.

Other casinos in the state are expected to follow suit in the coming days.

How Does Louisiana's Sports Betting Scene Work?

Louisiana joins New Jersey, Pennsylvania,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) West Virginia, and Mississippi as states that have legalized sports betting since the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on the activity in 2018.

Bets can be placed on most major sporting events at licensed land-based and online sportsbooks in Louisiana. Bettors must be at least 21 years old and located within the state to place wagers.

Sports betting is available through retail locations and online platforms operated by licensed gaming companies in Louisiana. Odds for each event are set by the gaming company, rather than the individual players or teams involved in the game.

What Sporting Events Can I Bet On?

At present, citizens of Louisiana can bet on most major sporting events, including college and professional football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, and golf. Motor racing and horse racing are also available for wagering. Future events such as the Super Bowl and NCAA Tournament can also be wagered on.

How Much Can I Bet?

The minimum bet allowed is $1 at most locations. However, there may be some establishments that allow for lower minimum bets. The maximum bet allowed varies depending on the sporting event and the location where the wager is placed but typically ranges from $2,000 to $5,000 per bettor per event.

      In response to Monday's launch of sports betting in Louisiana casinos Governor John Bel Edwards released this statement: "This is an historic day for Louisiana as we become one of five states in America with legalized sports betting...Our people can now enjoy this new form of entertainment while also benefiting from economic development associated with it." With nine other states preparing similar legislation it would appear that Edwards is correct about gambling being a new form of entertainment with benefits for those living within Louisiana borders - though it is yet to be seen whether Edwards' prediction regarding economic development comes true .
