#  Advocate Claims Gambling Losses can Equal Tax Savings

People are allowed to deduct gambling losses. Gambling losses can equal tax savings. Those in the know say to preserve your sanity, and your wallet, keep detailed records of your gambling activity.

The Internal Revenue Service allows taxpayers to subtract gambling losses from their winnings when filing their tax returns. This can be a significant deduction for those who gamble frequently.

Your winnings are reported as taxable income on line 21 of Form 1040. Your losses are reported as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A. You can only deduct the amount of your losses that is greater than the amount of your winnings.

If you have more losses than winnings, you cannot deduct the entire amount on Schedule A. You can only deduct the amount of your losses that is greater than the amount of your winnings. So, if you had $1,000 in winnings and $1,500 in losses, you can only deduct $500 of your losses on Schedule A ($1,500 - $1,000 = $500).

You must have records to substantiate your gambling deductions. This includes receipts from casinos and racetracks, cancelled checks, bank statements and credit card statements. If you are audited by the IRS, you will need to provide these records to support your deductions.

#  Don't Miss Out on these Tax Advantages of Gambling Losses

It can be tough to lose money, but when you do, it's best to make sure you take advantage of the tax benefits. According to the IRS, taxpayers are allowed to deduct gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. This means that if you have a bad day at the casino and come out $200 in the hole, you can claim that loss on your taxes.

This deduction is an itemized deduction, which means that you can only claim it if you are itemizing your deductions on your tax return. If you're taking the standard deduction, you can't claim your gambling losses.

Itemizing your deductions usually makes sense if your total deductions are more than the standard deduction amount that applies to you. For example, in 2017, the standard deduction for singles is $6,350, but if you have significant itemized deductions, it may be worth it to claim those instead.

Gambling losses are just one type of deductible expense. Others include mortgage interest, charitable donations, and state and local taxes. To figure out whether it's worth it for you to itemize your deductions instead of taking the standard deduction, use this handy IRS tool: https://www.irs.gov/tools/deduction-calculator .

If you do decide to itemize your deductions and include your gambling losses, make sure you keep careful track of them throughout the year. You'll need to report your winnings and losses on Form 1040, Schedule A . The form will ask for information such as the amount of each bet and the date of each bet.

#  Tips for Claiming your Gambling Losses on your Taxes

Did you know that you can claim your gambling losses on your taxes? If you’re like most people, you probably didn’t. And even if you did, you may not know exactly how to go about doing it. That’s why we’ve put together this guide to claiming your gambling losses on your taxes.

First things first: You need to keep track of your gambling losses. This includes not just the amount of money you lose, but also the dates and types of bets or wagers you made. It’s a good idea to keep a detailed record of all your gambling activity so that you have everything handy when it comes time to file your taxes.

Next, you’ll need to calculate your total losses for the year. To do this, simply add up the amount of money you lost during the year, as well as any associated expenses (like transportation costs, hotel fees, etc.).

Once you have your total losses calculated, it’s time to file your tax return. When doing so, be sure to include Form 1040 Schedule A, which is used specifically for deducting gambling losses. Note that only those losses that are greater than your winnings can be deducted – so if you won $100 but lost $200, only the $200 loss can be deducted on your taxes.

If you’re filing a joint return, both spouses will need to include Schedule A if they incurred any gambling losses during the year. And remember: Just because one spouse lost money gambling doesn’t mean that the other spouse gets to claim those losses on their taxes – each individual is responsible for reporting their own gambling activity separately.

While claiming your gambling losses may seem like a daunting task, it can actually be a relatively simple process if you have all the necessary paperwork in order. So be sure to follow these tips closely – and happy tax season!

Tax season is a great time to reflect on your gambling losses. If you are like most gamblers, you probably try to forget about your losses and hope the IRS doesn't ask too many questions. This year, make the most of your gambling losses by following these tips:

1. Keep good records. Make sure to keep accurate track of all of your gambling activity throughout the year. This includes both wins and losses, as well as the date, type of game, and amount wagered.

2. Report all losses. You are allowed to deduct your gambling losses from your taxable income. However, you can only deduct up to the amount of your winnings for the year. So, if you had $1,000 in winnings and $5,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 from your taxable income.

3. Claim the deduction on Schedule A. Gambling losses should be claimed on line 28 of Schedule A (Form 1040), below the entries for job expenses and other miscellaneous deductions.
